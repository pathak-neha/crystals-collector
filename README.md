- You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.
- The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
- Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of the crystal.

*_The Technical Details_*  
This simple app relies on BootStrap to improve the UI, and jQuery to manipulate the DOM, and vanilla JavaScript for the the underlying game logic.
